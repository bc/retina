# Project description

Retinal maps can take several hours to construct by hand or with proprietary software, and have been the industry standard for over thirty five yearsâ€”they appear in hundreds of publications. With our software, a researcher can produce *many* maps in one hour, make consistent comparisons, and generate useful statistics.

## Installation
- Download the latest release
- Open R and set the working directory to the unzipped `retina` folder
- Run `source("main.R")`. This will run the sample map.

It may complain that you don't have the right packages. To install them run e.g. `install.packages("ggplot2")`.
